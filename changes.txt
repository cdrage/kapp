0.3.0 of Kedge!

Here's what's new in Kedge 0.3.0:

  - __Building Docker Images!__ Kedge now supports building Docker images
  - `extraResources` has been renamed to `includeResources`
  - Refactoring + documentation updates

__Building Docker Images:__

Kedge will build (and optionally) push a Docker image, provided you are in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`.

Using an [example](https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge/tree/master/docs/examples/build):

```sh
$ kedge build -i surajd/ticker:0.1 -p
INFO[0000] Building image 'surajd/ticker:0.1' from directory 'build' 
INFO[0000] Image 'surajd/ticker:0.1' from directory 'build' built successfully 
INFO[0000] Pushing image "surajd/ticker:0.1" to registry "docker.io" 
INFO[0000] Multiple authentication credentials detected. Will try each configuration. 
INFO[0000] Attempting authentication credentials for "172.30.1.1:5000" 
ERRO[0003] Unable to push image "surajd/ticker:0.1" to registry "172.30.1.1:5000". Error: unauthorized: incorrect username or password 
INFO[0003] Attempting authentication credentials for "https://index.docker.io/v1/" 
INFO[0057] Successfully pushed image "surajd/ticker:0.1" to registry "https://index.docker.io/v1/" 
```

Now you can use the same (built) image in Kubernetes:

```sh
$ kedge create -f configs/
service "ticker" created
deployment "ticker" created
service "redis" created
deployment "redis" created
```

Now go try out Kedge! Go through our quick-start at [kedgeproject.org](http://kedgeproject.org) as well as our [documentation](https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge/tree/master/docs).
