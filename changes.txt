The first release of Kedge!

If you haven't tried out Kedge yet, it's a concise way of creating application definitions for Kubernetes.

Here's a simple example of using Kedge:

```sh
$ vim httpd.yaml
```

```yaml
name: httpd
containers:
- image: centos/httpd
services:
- name: httpd
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 80
```

```sh
$ kedge create -f httpd.yaml
deployment "httpd" created
service "httpd" created
```

Now go try out Kedge! Go through our quick-start at [kedgeproject.org](http://kedgeproject.org) as well as our [documentation](https://github.com/kedgeproject/kedge/tree/master/docs).
